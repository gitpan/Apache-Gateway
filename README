			   Apache::Gateway

The Apache::Gateway module implements a gateway using LWP with
assorted optional features.  From the HTTP 1.1 draft, a gateway is

    [a] server which acts as an intermediary for some other
    server.  Unlike a proxy, a gateway receives requests as if
    it were the origin server for the requested resource; the
    requesting client may not be aware that it is communicating
    with a gateway.

FEATURES

  * Standard Gateway Features implemented using LWP
  * Automatic Failover with Mirrored Instances
  * Multiplexing
  * Pattern-dependent Gatewaying
  * FTP Directory Gatewaying
  * Timestamp Correction

REQUIREMENTS

In order to install and use this package you will need Perl
version 5.004 or better, an Apache server with modperl, and the
appropriate administrative privileges to run Apache/Perl modules.

Apache::Gateway uses many other modules.
  * Apache::Constants
  * HTTP::Date
  * HTTP::Request
  * HTTP::Status
  * IO::File
  * LWP::UserAgent
  * Regexp
  * Time::Zone
  * URI::URL

These packages should be available on CPAN.

INSTALLATION

You install Apache::Gateway as you would install any perl module
library.  Use the CPAN module or run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

SUPPORTED PLATFORMS

I have built and tested Apache::Gateway under Linux.

DOCUMENTATION

See ChangeLog for a list of recent changes.  POD style documentation
is included in Gateway.pm.  This is normally converted to a manual
page and installed as part of the "make install" process.  You should
also be able to use the 'perldoc' utility to extract and read
documentation from the module file directly.

Definitions.txt defines some HTTP terms used in the documentation.
